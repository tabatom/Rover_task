# Rover_task
Mini project developed for interview

The code is written in Python.
Used packages are:
- random
- bottle
- requests

Tests are written in the "test" files.

To run tests, simply run the file.

Results in the tests for the rover_manager can vary as obstacles are simulated with a certain probability using random numbers.
